### Usage
To ensure the workflow triggers correctly:
1. Setup the github repo located at https://github.com/mahadmughal/gitlab_automation_tool as well. This repo should be setup locally and this repo is responsible to execute sub-workflow(Execute gitlab pipeline).
2. Verify that the paths to the script files are properly configured in the **Code** and **Command** nodes.  
3. Import both the workflows in n8n and then execute the main workflow(refund_security_deposit_workflow.json)
